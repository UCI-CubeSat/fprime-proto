# TestAntSat :satellite:

Welcome to the repository hosting code for _testing_ NASA's F' Flight Software and Embedded Systems Framework ([Link Here](https://nasa.github.io/fprime)) for [UCI CubeSat](https://projects.eng.uci.edu/projects/2023-2024/uci-cubesat)

Here's a short guide on how to get started and get to work with this repository.

## Downloading Dependencies

The following dependencies must be installed to properly run this code:

- `git`
- `Docker CLI`
  - For Mac Users, run: `brew install docker`
  - For Linux Users, run: `sudo apt-get install docker`
  - For Windows Users, run the `sudo` command in [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)
- [`Docker Desktop`](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
  - [Docker Quickstart Guides](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

## First-Time Setup

This repository contains quickstart scripts to simplify setup. These scripts run natively on MacOS and Linux, but _require_ WSL for windows. See the points under "Docker CLI" to install.

To set up the app on your local machine, do the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UCI-CubeSat/fprime-proto.git
# and
cd fprime-proto
# and
./Scripts/setup.sh
```

Once you do all of this, you have to recursively pull the `fprime` submodules that have been generated by GitHub to gain access to everything. Do so with this command:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Once that is done, you can install all dependencies with:

```
pip install -r fprime/requirements.txt
```

Lastly, you need to generate F' configurations and do the initial build of the project:

```bash
# in directory "fprime-proto"
fprime-util generate
# and
fprime-util build -j4
```

## Running the Application

F' is a large framework, so there's a _lot_ here to tackle. For best information on generating new components, deployments, Ground Station configurations, and more, refer to the official [F' website](https://nasa.github.io/fprime).

One thing to know is you can always run the F' Ground Station (GDS) by doing the following command in a deployment directory:

```bash
fprime-gds
```

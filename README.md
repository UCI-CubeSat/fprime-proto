# TestAntSat :satellite:

Welcome to the repository hosting code for testing NASA's F' Flight Software and Embedded Systems Framework ([Link Here](https://nasa.github.io/fprime)) for [UCI CubeSat](https://projects.eng.uci.edu/projects/2023-2024/uci-cubesat)

Here's a short guide on how to get started and get to work with this framework.

## Downloading Dependencies

The following dependencies must be installed to properly run this code:

- `git`
- `python3.9+`
- `cmake 3.28.1+`

```bash
# to quickly install on linux, do
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
# or on macOS with homebrew
brew install git && brew install cmake
```

- [`CMake`](https://cmake.org/download/) for Windows
- `Python` for both platforms can be found at https://www.python.org/
- `Git` can be found at https://git-scm.com/downloads

## First-Time Setup

To set up the app on your local machine, do the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UCI-CubeSat/fprime-proto.git
# and
cd fprime-proto
# and
python3 -m venv venv
# and
. venv/bin/activate # for Linux/WSL
source venv/bin/activate # for MacOS
. .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # for Windows PowerShell
# and
pip install -U fprime-tools
```

Once you do all of this, you have to recursively pull the `fprime` submodules that have been generated by GitHub to gain access to everything. Do so with this command:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Once that is done, you can install all dependencies with:

```
pip install -r fprime/requirements.txt
```

Lastly, you need to generate F' configurations and do the initial build of the project:

```bash
# in directory "fprime-proto"
fprime-util generate
# and
fprime-util build -j4
```

## Running the Application

F' is a large framework, so there's a _lot_ here to tackle. For best information on generating new components, deployments, Ground Station configurations, and more, refer to the official [F' website](https://nasa.github.io/fprime).

One thing to know is you can always run the F' Ground Station (GDS) by doing the following command in a deployment directory:
```bash
fprime-gds
```
